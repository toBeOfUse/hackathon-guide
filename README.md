# Hacker's Guide

This is a guide to building stuff at hackathons. It was originally written to help out people attending [KHE 2024](https://kent-hack-enough-2024.devpost.com/). It has since become a community project that aims to be useful to people attending similar events around the world. Contribute to it! Open a PR.
