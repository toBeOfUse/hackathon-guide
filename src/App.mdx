# A Quickstart Guide to Hackathons

Throwing together a revolutionary technical project that **shakes the world to its core** and ***permanently changes humans' relationship with technology*** in about 24 - 48 hours might sound hard, but it's really not.

All you need is an idea and the tools to implement it. For example: 

## Previous Projects

import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"
import {
    Carousel,
    CarouselContent,
    CarouselItem,
    CarouselNext,
    CarouselPrevious,
} from "@/components/ui/carousel"

{
<Carousel className="w-full max-w-xs mx-auto">
    <CarouselContent>
    {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (
        <CarouselItem key={index}>
        <div className="p-1">
            <Card>
            <CardContent className="flex flex-col aspect-square items-center justify-center p-6">
                <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight my-2">Escape Pursuit</h3>
                <p>HackPSU Spring 2024</p>
            </CardContent>
            </Card>
        </div>
        </CarouselItem>
    ))}
    </CarouselContent>
    <CarouselPrevious />
    <CarouselNext />
</Carousel>
}

### Key takeaways for success:

- Keep the scope of your project narrow - if you have an idea, try to just implement the core of it.
- **Put a little hot sauce on that bad boy.**
- Use libraries written in your chosen language that solve hard problems.
- Use a high-level framework that takes care of the routine details of the kind of project you're working on.

import {
    Accordion,
    AccordionContent,
    AccordionItem,
    AccordionTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion"

{
<Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
    <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Web Development</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
        Just use Flask.
    </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
}
