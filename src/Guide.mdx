# A Quickstart Guide to Hackathons

Throwing together a revolutionary technical project that **shakes the world to its core** and ***permanently changes humans' relationship with technology*** in about 24 - 48 hours might sound hard, but it's really not.

All you need is an idea and the tools to implement it. For example: 

## Previous Projects

import { CarouselTransformer } from '@/components/transformers.tsx';

<CarouselTransformer>

### Project 1

Description.

Description!

### Project 2

Description~

Description...

</CarouselTransformer>

### Key takeaways for success:

- Keep the scope of your project narrow - if you have an idea, try to just implement the core of it.
- **Put a little hot sauce on that bad boy.**
- Use libraries written in your chosen language that solve hard problems.
- Use a high-level framework that takes care of the routine details of the kind of project you're working on.
