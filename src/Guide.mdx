# A Quickstart Guide to Hackathons

Throwing together a revolutionary technical project that **shakes the world to its core** and ***permanently changes humans' relationship with technology*** in 24 - 48 hours might sound hard, but **it's really not**.

All you need is an idea and the tools to implement it. For example:

import { CarouselTransformer, PopoverTransformer } from '@/components/transformers.tsx';

### [Escape Pursuit](https://devpost.com/software/escape-pursuit)

##### HackPSU, Spring 2024

This online game adds an online component to hide-and-seek: both the hider and the seekers bring up the game on their phones, and then when the hider hides, the seekers are shown a randomly-placed circle on the map that the hider is *somewhere* within. The hider can explore a wide range of possible hiding spots, across a whole college campus, for example, but the game stays fair.

This is a simple enhancement to an age-old pastime that shows how technology can be integrated with the real world in a new way to create something fun.

##### Technologies Used
   
- Angular as the framework for creating the game's web interface
- MongoDB to store users' data while playing
- Google Maps to provide maps
- Cloudflare Workers to host the site

### Key takeaways for success:

- Keep the scope of your project narrow - if you have an idea, try to just implement the core of it.
- **Put a little hot sauce on that bad boy.**
- Use libraries written in your chosen language that solve hard problems.
- Use a high-level framework that takes care of the routine details of the kind of project you're working on.
