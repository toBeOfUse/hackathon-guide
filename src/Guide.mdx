# A Quickstart Guide to Hackathon Projects

Throwing together a *revolutionary* technical project that **shakes the world to its core** and ***permanently changes humanity's relationship with technology*** in 24 - 48 hours might sound hard, but **it's really not**.

All you need is an idea and the tools to implement it. Let's see how it's done.

## Preliminaries

First: meditate on the following behavioral principles:

**Don't over do it on the caffeine.** Try to eat relatively healthy. **Look for project ideas in the issues you run into in the real world.** Also bring jackets, blankets, pillows and stuff like that. Come in with a general idea of what you would like to do. Try to sketch it out ahead of time and assign tasks to people on your team (if you have a team). **You're on a timer**; have any specific software that you want to use downloaded ahead of time.

### [Escape Pursuit](https://devpost.com/software/escape-pursuit)

##### HackPSU, Spring 2024

This online game adds an online component to hide-and-seek: both the hider and the seekers bring up the game on their phones, and then when the hider hides, the seekers are shown a randomly-placed circle on the map that the hider is *somewhere* within. The hider can explore a wide range of possible hiding spots, across a whole college campus, for example, but the game stays fair.

This is a simple enhancement to an age-old pastime that shows how technology can be integrated with the real world in a new way to create something fun.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used
   
- Angular as the framework for creating the game's web interface
- MongoDB to store users' data while playing
- Google Maps to provide maps
- Cloudflare Workers to host the site

</PopoverTransformer>

### [RTCL](https://devpost.com/software/rtcl-article)

##### KHE 2022

This was a Python program that read PDFs and, with the help of a language model, created PowerPoint slides that summarized their contents.

These days, everyone knows AI can do this kind of thing, but back in October 2022, before ChatGPT was publicly released, this *blew people's minds*. This project found an application of technology that people weren't aware of yet, and took advantage of it to make something that was, at the time, almost brand new.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used
   
- pdfminer (a Python library) to get text from PDFs
- Cohere NLP to read the text and write some bullet points about it
  - ("NLP" is what people called it before "LLM"s were a thing)
- pptx (a Python library) to put them in PowerPoints 

</PopoverTransformer>

### [Single-Handed Typing](https://devpost.com/software/singlehanded-typing-tech)

##### KHE 2022

This project arose when someone decided it should be easier to type with one hand. There were surprisingly few quick solutions available, and the most intriguing idea didn't have a modern implementation. The final result of the project took that initial idea and ran with it, creating a new version that you could try out online and download to use within Windows on your computer.

This project wasn't completely original, but it did iterate on a forgotten concept that filled an actual need and only existed in an old blog post. Sometimes you just need someone to actually make the thing.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- `keyboard`, a Python library that can detect and modify keyboard input
- PyQt, a Python GUI library used to display a keyboard graphic in a window
- Vue and Nuxt to create the website that demoed the project

</PopoverTransformer>

{/*

these examples are kind of lame:

### [FaunaFinder](https://devpost.com/software/faunafinder-ai-powered-animal-breed-recognition)

##### MakeUC 2023

This AI-based application recognizes pictures of animals, brings up information about the species of those animals, and tells you about related animals that you might also want to know about.

There is still a lot of untapped potential within the world of AI, probably, and this project used it to connect people with animals.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- Flask, a Python library, to create a web server for the web interface
- Google Cloud Vision to recognize animals with AI
- APIs for Wikipedia and animal databases

</PopoverTransformer>

### [Subway Cheese Chase](https://devpost.com/software/subway-cheese-chase)

##### MakeUC 2023

This is simply a horror game about being in a dark Subway (restaurant) looking for your car keys.

Not every hackathon project has to be super serious!

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- Godot, a popular free game engine
- Blender, a program for creating 3D art

</PopoverTransformer>

### [CWRU Full-Text Class Search](https://devpost.com/software/cwru-full-text-class-search)

##### KHE 2019

This was a project developed by students from Case Western Reserve University who disapproved of their university's portal for class searches. So, they scraped the content of the portal and made their own website out of it.

This project *identified a way in which the human experience sucks* and took it upon itself to *fix* it.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- Scrapy, a Python library designed to turn web pages into data
- MongoDB to store the scraped data
- Elasticsearch to rapidly search the scraped text
- Google Cloud to host the resulting website

</PopoverTransformer>

### [Safe-Roads](https://devpost.com/software/safe-roads)

##### MakeUC 2023

This project uses publicly-available maps and data to visualize how dangerous any given segment of road is. I imagine this is perfect for anyone who's already anxious about driving.

This project shows how useful public datasets from websites like [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/) can be if given the right frame. The Internet has a ton of information on it that just needs a little bit of data science done to it to become relevant and accessible in people's lives.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- The Google Maps API, to get maps
- Streamlit, a Python framework for visualizing data, to visualize data

</PopoverTransformer>

### Key lessons for success:

- Use a high-level framework that takes care of the routine details of the kind of project you're working on. 
- **Put a little hot sauce on that bad boy.**
- As with all creative work, seeking inspiration from outside sources is underrated.
- Keep the scope of your project narrow - if you have an idea, try to just implement the core of it.

For more on those last two points, read on:

### Web Development

This is currently the most common way to create apps, with a server application taking care of computation and data storage whilst familiar UI materializes in a browser. 

---

<img alt="A retro graphic of a rotating globe." src="www.gif" width="114" height="106" className="mx-auto max-w-full" />

<p className='text-center mt-4 mb-2 text-base'>**For Inspiration**: The [val.town showcase](https://www.val.town/explore/community-showcase)</p>
<p className='text-center mb-6 text-base'>**Study Spot**: The [MDN Developer Guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guides)</p>

The web technologies that were originally developed for the creation of Geocities pages and mailing list address forms eventually broke containment and infiltrated every single facet of the modern world.

Generally, to use them, you need to create a **backend server application** that can store data, make itself available on a network, and usually do most of the actual work that the thing you're making needs to do. When a web browser (aka a **client**) connects to it, the backend server will send **client-side code** to the browser that will tell the browser what to display to the user. The server application is known as the **backend**; the client-side code is called the **frontend**.

Except,

#### Do you need a backend?

The languages that the browser understands are HTML (for content), CSS (for styling and layout), and JavaScript (for interactivity.) Frontend code, which runs in the browser, needs to be written in or compiled to those languages. (By "compiled to," I mean that you might use e.g. TypeScript instead of JavaScript, but then you're going to need a *build step* in your workflow that turns your code *into* JavaScript.)

You can, in fact, write tons of different apps in pure client-side code. These are apps that don't need to use any data that exists outside of one person's browser. Cool projects like [the Unsure Calculator](https://filiph.github.io/unsure/) or even the [HexEd.it Hex Editor](https://hexed.it/) work entirely in frontend code in JavaScript. You can even still import libraries published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) from a CDN like [https://esm.sh/](https://esm.sh/).

<small className="block mt-3">(Note for pedants: Browsers also understand WebAssembly, and you technically always need a backend in that you need something to send the HTML, CSS, JSS, and, yes, WASM files to the browser, but, you get the idea.)</small>

This is a less popular option these days, though, since a lot of people use tools like TypeScript or React that need that aforementioned *build step* before their code can run in a browser, and that *build step* has to run in some kind of server-side environment, since it definitionally can't run in the browser itself.

#### You might!

Furthermore, you definitely do need a backend if you need to coordinate and share data between multiple browsers, like a social media site or a chat app where posts/messages that are created by one person need to be viewable by other people.

The simplest way to get a backend is to use a site like [val.town](https://www.val.town/) for quick, easy hosting. val.town lets you write a JavaScript function that has access to some simple external storage mechanisms, and runs it in the cloud like magic whenever a user visits its URL.

On the other hand, if you want to run the server application on your own computer, and you're willing to write it in JavaScript, the simplest way is to probably write it using the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework, running the resulting code by feeding it into Node.js. Or, since backend code doesn't need to run in the browser, and thus can be written in any language, you can use the venerable framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), which will help you write a server application in Python.

#### Why not both?

There are also "full-stack" web development frameworks that manage both the backend server-side stuff and the fancy frontend interface stuff simultaneously. The most popular of those is probably currently [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which lets you write JavaScript that runs on the server and JavaScript that runs in the browser and kind of intermix them freely. This is very powerful, but it can also be extremely confusing when you can't figure out where the code you've written is even running. Also, note that Next.js requires you to learn [React](https://react.dev/) for the frontend part. Other full-stack frameworks include [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/).

#### Note

- Yes, there are zillions of web development frameworks. We'll come up with one that leaves your sanity intact eventually.

### Artificial Intelligence

This term typically refers to technology that can make sense out of the ambiguities involved in natural phenomena like language or images in a probabilistic way.

---

<p className='text-center mb-6 text-base'>**For Inspiration**: [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)</p>

<img alt="A robot breakdancing, with the caption 'I was built to the destroy but right now I'm busy'" src="ai.jpg" className="mx-auto max-w-full" width="600" height="372" />

Artificial intelligence is a highly technical field replete with functions with weird names like softmax and sigmoid and the promise that it'll replace us all (humans) any minute now, but the basic ideas are actually pretty approachable, and there are a lot of tools out there right now that package up the last few decades of the field's progress so you don't have to redo it.

{/* TODO: list of things that you can do with AI: chatbot, chained chatbots, content generation, agents, embeddings,  */}

Here are a few ways to [delve](https://www.businessinsider.com/y-combinator-paul-graham-delve-ai-chatgpt-giveaway-email-pitch-2024-4) into this fertile territory, from least to most hands-on:

### Using existing tools via APIs

- As covered in the other section, APIs let you request data from other people's computers and use it in your own endeavors. The [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), which you can use to get freshly generated text or images or transcribed audio or various other things, is the basis of tons of products and projects. However, as such, it's not free.
  - If you haven't opened an OpenAI account before, you are granted $5 of free credit for signing up, which expires after three months; $5 doesn't sound like a lot, but if you look at [OpenAI's pricing](https://openai.com/pricing), it can go a fairly long way.
- Google offers a lot more free credit for its [AI tools](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing), including [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/pricing), its large language model. You can use Gemini 2.0 Flash for free at a maximum rate of [15 requests per minute](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#current-rate-limits) - that won't let you deploy a product to hundreds of thousands of users, but it can be useful for a hackathon project here and there.
- Cohere, which has recently released a few large language models in the Command R family that have performed decently in the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, also offers free access to their API through a trial API key, although again, [there are rate limits](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/rate-limits).

### Using existing tools through libraries

- There are also many options for those ambitious enough to want to install a mechanical soul into their own actual computer. [ollama](https://ollama.com/) is a program that lets you run a variety of large language models locally for text completion and chat, including [via Python](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python), although you'll be expected to have pretty decent specs to run the high-end ones.
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) provides a vast array of models for different use cases that involve handling text, images, and audio, most of which can be downloaded and utilized in a few lines of code using their [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) Python library. Again, you might have to be a little bit patient to get results on an ordinary computer, but it is more exciting to see things like speech recognition happen right there in front of you.
- Also, there exist higher-level libraries that can make use of local and non-local machine learning models, like [LangChain](https://www.ibm.com/topics/langchain), which is a popular framework for building applications around large language models using techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the AI is given the ability to skim through text that you provide to identify relevant information and answer your questions. (Basically.)

### Training brand new models

Although getting new machine learning models working takes quite a bit of ambition and patience, it is interesting to see how computers can turn data into the appearance of intelligence, and there are two whole extremely popular Python libraries to do it with.

- [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) has more stars on Github so I'm putting it first. It is a machine learning library created by Google and later integrated with another library called Keras that provides a high-level interface to the problem of turning e.g. a gigantic number of pictures of birds into a machine learning model that can recognize species of bird. It also provides access to [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), which provides many models pre-trained for things like image recognition, which can be customized to recognize specific kinds of images, like those of birds.
- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) is used more by academics and is also perfectly capable of being used to create a bird recognizer. Although it seems to me like a lot of generalist usage of these libraries is centered around recognizing pictures of things, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) is a YouTube video where a former OpenAI engineer uses PyTorch to build a GPT-style LLM, which is something.

Note that [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) both provide [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)–based Python environments that are commonly used to test out AI projects.

### APIs

What is an API? What isn't an API? Is Santa Claus my parents?

---

<p className='text-center mb-6'>**For Inspiration**: [This curated list of public APIs](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists)</p>

API stands for Application Programming Interface and it is a very broad term that can refer to any agreed-upon system for enabling two or more chunks of code to interact in a constructive way.

A lot of the time, though, an API is going to turn out to be a service that provides structured data over the Internet. A classic example is the OpenWeather API. You can send it a request for information, and your program will get back data in some specified format like JSON or XML that informs it what the weather is, was, or is predicted to be in a certain area. It will handle a certain amount of requests for free, and then expect you to pay up for more. You can create a program that uses that data to do things like critique picnicking schedules.

There are generic, universal libraries for making API requests over the Internet like Python's [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library or JavaScript's [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) function. (Confusingly, `fetch` itself is referred to as an API, just because it's a way for your code to interact with the code that someone else wrote that actually sends a request over the Internet. It's APIs all the way down.) But often, libraries exist that provide pre-programmed ways to request data from any given API, like [this Python library](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm) that lets you get weather data with simple function calls, or the OpenAI [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) libraries that give you an easy way to pull information from the OpenAI API. Keep an eye out for libraries like this, because they can be helpful.

### Apps

Creating simple and useful programs that one can install on one's phone or computer is still a thing.

---

Installable apps that are built for a specific operating system and type of device can benefit in speed, look, and feel compared to web apps. There are usually relatively straightforward recommended ways to build apps for a specific platform, set forth by the by the platforms' creators. How you create your app depends largely on where you want it to run, so let's go through the possibilities:

#### Windows

Windows apps, otherwise known as like, normal computer programs, are a thing, because a lot of people use Windows computers. If you want to create an app for Windows, you should probably use the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework. It lets you create apps using XAML, which is like HTML but for Windows, and C#. The simplest way to use WPF is to create a new project with it in [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

#### MacOS/iOS

Apple's devices currently use the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) framework for creating apps, which is built around the new-ish programming language called Swift.

#### Android

Android apps are currently usually built in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) using a new-ish programming language called Kotlin. (Android apps used to be written in Java, but Kotlin is the officially ordained Java-compatible successor.)

#### Cross-Platform for Desktop

[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is a C++ library that is mostly used to make desktop apps for MacOS, Linux, and Windows by projects ranging from Maya to VLC Player. It also has a Python bindings. It's an older framework, so expect a little bit of friction while figuring its object-oriented approach out.

#### Cross-Platform for Mobile

Guess what, [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is a popular way to create apps for phones that are not on the web but somehow still use JavaScript. God why. [Expo](https://expo.dev/) is a neat framework for very quickly creating React Native apps that are served from the cloud.

#### Cross-platform in General

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is a new-ish framework created by Google that I've seen work well on desktop and on mobile. It has the advantage of being one of the only popular cross-platform frameworks that doesn't rely on JavaScript; this gives it better performance and, a lot of the time, more native-feeling UI.

### Data Analysis

What does data know? Does it know things? Let's find out!

---

<img alt="A screenshot of a very old version of Microsoft Excel, showing a generic spreadsheet called 'Working Capital Management.' Clippy is there." src="data.png" width="640" height="480" className="mx-auto max-w-md" />

<p className='text-center my-6'>**For Inspiration**: [Kaggle's Featured Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)</p>

Data analysis projects lean more on the analysis part than the specific technical implementation; it's less framework-dependent than apps are. Nevertheless, there are some important tools that you should know that you can use as part of your project:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a site with a very simple and important purpose: it hosts vast datasets that people can do data analysis on.
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that's built for doing statistical operations over large sets of data. It's very different than most programming languages; it's truly data-oriented, and doesn't have much of the if-then procedural logic that most coders are used to. Once you have R, you can install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), which is a specialized IDE that makes it easier to run programs and deal with R's input and output, and gives you the [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file format that lets you present your data analysis findings more beautifully.
- Python is also a programming language. Unlike R, it's a multi-paradigm language with procedural, functional, and object-oriented features, and has a wide general-purpose appeal. But it also has a whole family of tools that are commonly used with each other for data analysis:
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an extremely common way to make graphs and charts.
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a library that lets you manipulate "data frames" (basically, tables) with highly efficient syntax in a suspiciously R-like way.
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a library that's used to do bulk operations on numbers more quickly and efficiently than normal Python code does.
  - ✨Notebooks✨ are really the star of the show here. Originating with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), the Python community has conspired to create a format where you write out "cells" of Markdown text and Python code in order to present the data analysis that comes out of your Python in an organized way. The charts that Matplotlib makes and the data frames that you create with Pandas can be smoothly displayed in notebook cells, along with tons of other things. There are a number of implementations of the basic notebook idea out there now, from [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try) to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to [Kaggle Code](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a Python framework that's important enough for me to give it a top-level bullet point of its own. Streamlit is built to ingest data and turn it into a reader-friendly dashboard; you write Python program that creates charts, graphs, descriptions, and controls, and Streamlit streams the content to a web browser to view and interact with it.
- [Observable Notebooks](https://observablehq.com/platform/notebooks) are JavaScript's answer to Jupyter notebooks - you create notebooks that consist of a series of cells that, unlike in Jupyter notebooks, "observe" each other, sharing data and updating based on each other's values, letting you create live views of data that also tap into the powerful [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library for data visualization.

## Takeaways

The most important thing to remember at a hackathon is to **have fun** and **be yourself**. And win. Honestly, the best advice I can give is to go in with a project idea that is specific, interesting, and doable within the given time period. This guide will hopefully help to give you inspiration for that, and ideally help you figure out how you're going to build that.

Given that, don't let this list of technologies hold you back! The above is meant to be a survey of the most common ways to accomplish different tasks, not an exhaustive list of interesting bases for projects. You can ignore all of the above and build a GUI in Zig or a command line app in Lisp, as long as it does something interesting and you learn something while doing it.
