# A Quickstart Guide to Hackathons

Throwing together a revolutionary technical project that **shakes the world to its core** and ***permanently changes humans' relationship with technology*** in 24 - 48 hours might sound hard, but **it's really not**.

All you need is an idea and the tools to implement it. For example:

import { CarouselTransformer, PopoverTransformer } from '@/components/transformers.tsx';

### [Escape Pursuit](https://devpost.com/software/escape-pursuit)

##### HackPSU, Spring 2024

This online game adds an online component to hide-and-seek: both the hider and the seekers bring up the game on their phones, and then when the hider hides, the seekers are shown a randomly-placed circle on the map that the hider is *somewhere* within. The hider can explore a wide range of possible hiding spots, across a whole college campus, for example, but the game stays fair.

This is a simple enhancement to an age-old pastime that shows how technology can be integrated with the real world in a new way to create something fun.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used
   
- Angular as the framework for creating the game's web interface
- MongoDB to store users' data while playing
- Google Maps to provide maps
- Cloudflare Workers to host the site

</PopoverTransformer>

### [RTCL](https://devpost.com/software/rtcl-article)

##### KHE 2022

This was a Python program that read PDFs and, with the help of a language model, created PowerPoint slides that summarized their contents.

These days, everyone knows AI can do this kind of thing, but back in October 2022, before ChatGPT, this **blew people's minds**. This project found an application of technology that people weren't used to yet. 

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used
   
- pdfminer (a Python library) to get text from PDFs
- Cohere NLP to read the text and write some bullet points about it
  - ("NLP" is what people called it before "LLM"s were a thing)
- pptx (a Python library) to put them in PowerPoints 

</PopoverTransformer>

### [Single-Handed Typing (KHE 2022)](https://devpost.com/software/singlehanded-typing-tech)

##### KHE 2022

This was a project created by someone who once broke their arm and wasn't able to type with one of their hands. To improve this kind of situation for everyone, they decided to try to implement an old idea for a dynamic one-handed keyboard layout they found.

This project wasn't completely original, but it did iterate on a forgotten concept that then only existed in old Linux config files. Sometimes you just need someone to actually make the thing.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- keyboard, a Python library that can detect and modify keyboard input
- PyQt, a Python library used to display stuff in a window
- Vue and Nuxt to create the website that demoed the project

</PopoverTransformer>

### [FaunaFinder (MakeUC 2023)](https://devpost.com/software/faunafinder-ai-powered-animal-breed-recognition)

##### MakeUC 2023

This AI-based application recognizes pictures of animals, brings up information about the species of those animals, and tells you about related animals that you might also want to know about.

There is still a lot of untapped potential within the world of AI, probably, and this project used it to connect people with animals.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- Flask, a Python library, to create a web server for the web interface
- Google Cloud Vision to recognize animals with AI
- APIs for Wikipedia and animal databases

</PopoverTransformer>

### [Subway Cheese Chase (MakeUC 2023)](https://devpost.com/software/subway-cheese-chase)

##### MakeUC 2023

This is simply a horror game about being in a dark Subway (restaurant) looking for your car keys.

Not every hackathon project has to be super serious!

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- Godot, a popular free game engine
- Blender, a program for creating 3D art

</PopoverTransformer>

### [CWRU Full-Text Class Search (KHE 2019)](https://devpost.com/software/cwru-full-text-class-search)

##### KHE 2019

This was a project developed by students from Case Western Reserve University who disapproved of their university's portal for class searches. So, they scraped the content of the portal and made their own website out of it.

This project **identified a part of our built environment that sucks** and **decided to try to fix it**.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- Scrapy, a Python library designed to turn web pages into data
- MongoDB to store the scraped data
- Elasticsearch to rapidly search the scraped text
- Google Cloud to host the resulting website

</PopoverTransformer>

### [Safe-Roads (MakeUC 2023)](https://devpost.com/software/safe-roads)

##### MakeUC 2023

This project uses publicly-available maps and data to visualize how dangerous any given segment of road is. I imagine this is perfect for anyone who's already anxious about driving.

This project shows how useful public datasets from websites like [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/) can be if given the right frame. The Internet has a ton of information on it that just needs a little bit of data science done to it to become relevant and accessible in people's lives.

<PopoverTransformer>

##### Technologies Used

- The Google Maps API, to get maps
- Streamlit, a Python framework for visualizing data, to visualize data

</PopoverTransformer>

### Key takeaways for success:

- Keep the scope of your project narrow - if you have an idea, try to just implement the core of it.
- **Put a little hot sauce on that bad boy.**
- Use libraries written in your chosen language that solve hard problems.
- Use a high-level framework that takes care of the routine details of the kind of project you're working on.
